# Data Engineer
Profile introduction

I am a Data Engineer specializing in building robust, scalable data pipelines and optimizing ETL processes using Python. I have extensive experience transforming raw, messy datasets—including customer, product, and sales data—into high-integrity, production-ready environments. Beyond basic data movement, I focus on building resilient systems that handle data quality issues, missing values, and outliers automatically. I am passionate about architecting data infrastructures that empower teams to make data-driven decisions with total confidence in their underlying systems.
